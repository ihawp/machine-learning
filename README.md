# Machine Learning with C++

Currently, the code contains a minor CLI for training and testing mlpack's Linear Regression and Logistic Regression classes.

There is example data located in ***world_happiness_data***.

## Prepare Your Data

Assuming your data is in CSV format, you can use the ***csv.py*** file to clean your CSV file(s).

If you choose to use the example data then forgetaboutit, everything you need should be there.

## Use the CLI
